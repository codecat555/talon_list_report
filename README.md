# Talon List Report

Provides a voice command for displaying a simple text report on one or more Talon lists. The report shows where each list is defined and where it is referenced (which commands and capture rules).

I mainly developed this report as part of a QA exercise for some other code I was writing. I was seeing some Talon API behavior I didn't understand and developing this report was helpful in that regard.

If this proves to be more popular than I expect, it would be good to convert the generated report into HTML.

## Installation

1. Download this module into your Talon user folder.

## Usage

See the `talon_list_report.talon` file for the voice commands available.
